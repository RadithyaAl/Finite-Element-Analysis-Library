# Finite-Element-Analysis-Library

Hello. this is the repository for me to share my boreness activity when i'm taking finite element in this semester. 

I hope i wont fucked up with this class hahaha.

i'm planning to create some library to solve finite element problems using python code and eventually, i will be writting code to solve finite element for the hexahedral mesh from stl files. 

i guess i will be knock myself out since i'm taking 24 credits in this semester. (hopefully i able to survive)
